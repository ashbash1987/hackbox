# Creating your first room

To create your first room with Hackbox, you need to send a POST request to `https://app.hackbox.ca/rooms` containing the following data:

| Parameter Name | Type | Default | Required | Description |
| -------------- | ---- | ------- | -------- | ----------- |
| `hostId` | `string` | N/A | Yes | This is the "password" to your Hackbox room - it will be used to connect to the WebSocket. If shared, your room could be hijacked. |
| `twitchRequired` | `boolean` | `false` | No | Sets whether or not the room requires Twitch authentication to join. |
| `roomCode` | `string` | `undefined` | No | If provided, you can set a custom room code. |

And as a typescript interface:

```typescript
interface CreateRoomQueryParams {
    hostId: string;
    twitchRequired: boolean | undefined;
    roomCode: string | undefined;
}
```


After sending this, Hackbox will respond in one of the following ways:

```json
// room successfully created
{
    "ok": true,
    "roomCode": "[ROOM CODE HERE]"
}

// room code is unavailable
{
    "error": "room code unavailable"
}

// the room code doesn't follow the required format (4 letters)
{
    "error": "invalid room code"
}
```
